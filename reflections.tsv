Happiness	Play is all about joy.... If you observe children at play (we’re talking more about finger painting with mud than about championship soccer here), you will see the type of play we are talking about. Play is any activity that brings you joy when you do it. It can certainly include organized activity or competition or productive endeavours, but when those things are done “for the joy of it” they are play. When an activity is done to win, to advance, to achieve—even if it’s “fun” to do so—it’s not play. It may be a wonderful thing, but it’s still not play. The question here is what brings you joy purely in the doing.
Self Improvment	Shut up and listen.... Really really listen - it allows us to respond properly and you'll genuinely enjoy it - we learn...
Misc	Don’t make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn’t working. Reframe the solution to some other possibilities, prototype those ideas (take some test hikes), and get yourself unstuck. Anchor problems keep us stuck because we can only see one solution—the one we already have that doesn’t work. Anchor problems are not only about our current, failed approach. They are really about the fear that, no matter what else we try, that won’t work either, and then we’ll have to admit that we’re permanently stuck—meaning we’re screwed—and we’d rather be stuck than screwed.
Self Improvment	Before criticizing or feeling the need to make a comment leave it till the next day and sleep on it... If it's genuinely important you'll bring it up than.
Happiness	My thoughts are only thoughts – they’re not actually me or who I am. I can step back and ignore them, I don’t have to let “ego” get in the way of my happiness.
Happiness	Complete this sentence – I’m 70 years old and I wish I’d spent more time on..… and I wish I’d spent less time on……
Happiness	Looking always into the future of when things will be happier/better is counter intuitive; how often do we look at the exact moment we are in and feel truly unhappy? Enjoying every “now” moment is enjoying life.
Happiness	Always searching for the “perfect” in life, hijacks our current happiness. Instead of searching for perfection compare the situation against the worst case, it usually gives you a healthier sense of perspective.
Self Improvment	Remember that it’s my judgment about the infuriating colleague, or the heavy traffic, or the burned food, that is the cause of my distress, not the situation itself.
Self Improvment	Sometimes, the most valuable of all talents is to be able not to seek resolution; to notice the craving for completeness or certainty or comfort, and not to feel compelled to follow where it leads.
Self Improvment	Next time I'm in a meeting - speak up! Concentrate, speak slow and clearly - read the room and ensure everyone's face is showing that I'm clear for everyone.
Leadership	Remember to bring the positivity everywhere you can. e.g. Look at Paul Kilmister and the way he speaks to everyone in the team pushing the moral on the shop floor/shitty job. Positivity is important.
Business	A quick no is better than a slow yes
Business	When meeting a team/person for the first time, the best question to ask is “What’s your biggest problem today?”
Leadership	Explain to people the context of why we do/ask for things – it brings them on-board. For example: In the RC inflow reviews, don’t just ask people to check with procurement first – explain that, the pre-cost is the critical path to their hypothesis. By validating that, we know 99% of the rest should be OK – always validate the “kill” factor in the hypothesis first. Explain to people that the ROI isn’t just a number – that it links to an NPV and how this impacts the business. That an ROI of 50 isn’t what’s important, it’s actually the payback period.
Coaching	“Can I give you some feedback? / May I share something with you?” - Always ask, positive or negative  1) “When you…” - Talk about their behavior 2)“Here’s what happens…” - Describe the impact 3)“How can you do this differently?” or “Thanks – keep this up.”  Feedback is always about future behavior. It’s NOT about the past, because there’s nothing we can do about the past. We want to get different behavior in the future if it’s adjusting. We want more of the same if it’s affirming. Do not use adjusting feedback as punishment – your team members know when they’ve made a mistake, and nobody likes punishment. If you use this model regularly, making it a habit, your people will start ASKING for more.  If people push back or roll their eyes, you can simply say I see this isn't a good time than - perhaps some other time. If they insist you can politely push back to say honestly its cool, it’s about trying to give some feedback and if you’re not in the right frame of mind than let’s do it another time, we've all been there before. No matter what, we don't argue with people - simply agree and walk away to defuse the situation.
Lean	With standardised work real problems surface quickly, because deviations become visible. For example, if deliveries had to leave a warehouse within two hours and were color coded by the time of the day, then identifying and fixing problems would be easy. But in order to do that, the work flow would have to be stable and standard; otherwise, the manager would be firefighting  to handle temporary surges with no permanent solution to the real problem, which is the demand surge (other than adding flexible capacity). Similarly, when a substantial degree of work is standardized, it is possible to use reliable and tested technology that serves your people and processes. Changes are easily evaluated. They can be studied in a controlled environment to see if the impact is substantial and then adopted into practice after being vetted by a team (data driven experimentation)
Lean	Examples in the warehouse of the 7 wastes include the following:  ● Transportation (driving an empty forklift) ● Defects (time spent correcting errors such as misspicks) ● Inventories (congestion at the inbound and outbound areas) ● Motion (interrupting movement such as staging product before put-away) ● Waiting time (bottlenecks at pick locations) ● Overproduction (holding too much inventory) ● Overprocessing (performing unnecessary steps such as labelling and checking)
Quote	People like the results but not necessarily the curiosity to get there
Digitisation	But the goal of data science is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop profound new business capabilities.  Algorithmic products and services like recommendations systems, client engagement bandits, style preference classification, size matching, fashion design systems, logistics optimizers, seasonal trend detection, and more can’t be designed up-front.  They need to be learned - there are no blueprints to follow; with data science, you learn as you go, not before you go.
Digitisation	Data is valuable not just for companies like Google and Facebook but for any business today, data—like intellectual property, patents, or a brand—is a key intangible asset.  The importance of that asset will vary somewhat based on the nature of the business (just as brands have greater importance to a fashion company than an industrial manufacturer). But data is an important asset to every business today—and neglected at our peril.
Digitisation	By treating data as a key intangible asset to build over time, every business can develop a data strategy that informs critical decision making and generates new value for business and customer alike.  Data allows us to continually experiment, learn, and test our ideas. This means data can do more than power products, optimize processes, and deliver more-relevant customer interactions; it can also help change the way organizations learn and innovate.  This diferent kind of learning— through constant experimentation—is at the heart of a profoundly diferent  approach to innovation.
Leadership	All it takes is a belief that people are fundamentally good—and enough courage to treat your people like owners instead of machines. Machines do their jobs; owners do whatever is needed to make their companies and teams successful.
Leadership	Give people slightly more trust, freedom, and authority than you are comfortable giving them. If you’re not nervous, you haven’t given them enough.
Leadership	Poor performance is rarely because the person is incompetent or a bad person. It’s typically a result of a gap in skill (which is either fixable or not) or will (where the person is not motivated to do the work). In the latter case, it could be a personal issue or a useful sign that there is something bigger wrong with the team that needs to be addressed.
Self Improvment	A simple exercise to instill mindfulness is to sit quietly and focus on your breathing for two minutes. It’s also been shown to improve cognitive functioning and decision-making.
Self Improvment	Good leaders are positive, even when things go bad.  Good leaders practice positive thinking. They view stressful situations from a more positive perspective, which takes emotional intelligence. Rather than getting stressed out about a work situation or a recent failure, they look at it as an opportunity to pause, regroup, learn, grow, and bounce back with renewed energy and focus. This can have a profound effect on one's emotional and physical well-being. Leaders who maintain a positive attitude and practice positive thinking experience less stress than those who are pessimistic, narrow-minded, and negative. 
Business	Agility goes down the drain when you outsource work.  The problem with outsourcing is that on paper it seems like a no-brainer: Development costs VS the fixed costs. It is expensive to bind existing resources on a task. It is even more expensive if you need to hire new employees.  The problem with outsourcing is that you pay someone to build stuff for you. It does not matter who you pay to do something for you, they need to make money. His agenda will be to spend as less time as possible on your work. That is why outsourcing requires contracts, detailed specifications, timetables and delivery dates.  He doesn’t want to spend additional time on a project, only because you want changes in the middle. Every unplanned change costs him time and therefore money. He is not going to put his mind into improving the product while developing. Firstly because he does not have the big picture. Secondly because he does not want to. He is doing as he is told - Who can blame him? If I was the subcontractor I would do exactly the same! Does this sound agile to you?  According to Elon Musk knowledge is king, do everything in house, that’s why startups are so productive. No time is wasted on waiting for someone else. If something does not work, or needs to be changed, there is someone in the team who can do it right away.
Coaching	Some example of strong coaching questions:  ● So if I can summarize here... ● So if I may just interrupt you for a moment, you’re saying  that... ● So let me see if I’m following your train of thought here. In  summary, what you think is... ● So if you left here today with what you wanted, what would  have changed for you? ● What’s the gap between what you want (the ideal outcome)  and the current state? ● What will happen if you do nothing? ● What’s a reasonable time to come back to me?  Make it a principle to start every question with the word ‘what’ ● What have you already tried? - it's an open question ● what do you want from your career?  The other word that is helpful for beginning a question is  ‘how’. ● How will you do that? ● How could you make that happen? ● How do you think people will respond?
Coaching	During coaching sessions ensure they clarify abstract words, e.g. ask the coachee to explain what the word means for them by spelling out the behaviour that would be visible:  ● So when you say you’d like your team to be more efficient, what would that mean in terms of what you’d actually see them doing? ● You say you are feeling that we’re in a rut here, but tell me a bit more about how you feel this is showing itself ● You said you want me to be more accessible, but what specifically do you have in mind?  Most people tend to think in terms of problems rather than outcomes. Getting your coachee to think in terms of outcomes helps them to focus on solutions rather than  excuses.
Coaching	OSCAR stands for  Outcome, Situation, Choices and Consequences, Action, and  Review.  ● OUTCOME (The destination) What would you like to achieve from this session?  This is where you help the coachee clarify the outcome they want around the issue they  have raised.  ● SITUATION (The starting point) What is the current situation? This is where you get clarity around where the coachee is right now. The purpose is to raise the awareness of the person being coached and the questioning in this section is for the benefi of the person being coached not the coach.  ● CHOICES & CONSEQUENCES (The route options) What have you already tried / What choices do you have? This is where you help the coachee to generate as many alternative courses of actions as possible, increasing their awareness about the consequences (upsides and downsides) of each choice.  ● ACTIONS (The detailed plan) What actions will you take? This is where you help the coachee review the options generated, to clarify the steps forward, and to take responsibility for their own action plan.  ● REVIEW (Making sure you are on track) What steps will you take to review your progress? This is where you help the coachee to check that they are on course. This helps you as their boss to be fully informed about what your team member is doing and why.
Digitisation	Machine learning is where you say what you want with examples, not with instructions
Business	The world has become significantly more complicated (particularly that of engineering / data / digitsation) no one person has the 100% solution.  Inclusivness and colabortion is key to allmost every question / challenge we now face. If people ask why teamwork / collaboration are important, its simply this - no one person / skill set can cover everything.
Digitisation	Data anaylsts / scients need an appreication for urgency - to understand and appreicate the cost of payroll. This topic costs us 12 months wages, it cant simply be for a "hunch" or academic interst - we need to see a path to value!
Digitisation	When looking at a new technology or application / assess it from 4 angles as at the end of the day it will all be about balancing the tradeoffs:  ● What problems does it eliminate? ● Which problems stay? ● What new problems does it bring? ● How will we have to change the existing rules, processes & assumptions to exploit this new technology?
Business	The skills gap isnt just about forward looking / innovation type talent - we'll find more and more of this as new generation begins being trained on it (e.g. ML / AI)  Our industry has many specific tools / skills / knowledge that needs to be maintained for over 30+ years (think SAP Z transactions / difficult, specific knowledge compared to something like SQL) These skills need to be kept, retrained and managed as well
